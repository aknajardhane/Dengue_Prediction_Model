<p><h1>Dengue Prediction Modle</h1><br>
Machine Learning changed the way of solving problems. <br>
Industries like Healthcare utilizing ML for detecting tumors and changed the way of diagnosing,<br>
Finance is now dependent upon public opinions(sentiments) and scientists used to mine these opinions to take\<br>
 the best out of it.</p>

<p>Can you predict local epidemics of dengue fever?</p>

<p>Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. In mild cases, <br>
symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, <br>
low blood pressure, and even death.</p>

<p>Because it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. <br>
Although the relationship to climate is complex, a growing number of scientists argue that climate change is likely to produce distributional <br>
shifts that will have significant public health implications worldwide.</p>

<p>In recent years dengue fever has been spreading. Historically, <br>
the disease has been most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands.</p>

<p>Using environmental data collected by various U.S. <br>
Federal Government agencies&mdash;from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. <br>
Department of Commerce&mdash;can you predict the number of dengue fever cases reported each week in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Iquitos, Peru?</p>

<p>This is an intermediate-level practice competition. <br>
Your task is to predict the number of dengue cases each week (in each location) based on environmental variables describing changes in temperature, <br>
precipitation, vegetation, and more.</p>

<p>An understanding of the relationship between climate and dengue dynamics can improve research initiatives and resource allocation to help fight life-threatening pandemics.</p>
